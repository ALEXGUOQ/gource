#summary Using Gource with SVN projects via git-svn

== Using Gource with SVN projects via git-svn ==

SVN is not supported directly, however you could can import your project into a Git repository using the '`git svn`' command.

The below insturctions will work if your SVN repository has the standard three directories - trunk, tags and branches
(Otherwise, see the '`git svn`' documentation):

{{{
git svn init --stdlayout https://myrepo.example.org/svn my-repo.git
cd my-repo.git
git svn fetch
}}}

*Note:* `git svn fetch` may take hours if your repository is large.

You can pull new changes into the Git copy of your SVN repository at any time using the following command:

{{{
git svn rebase
}}}
