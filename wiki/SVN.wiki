#summary Using Gource with SVN

There are a couple ways to use Gource with an SVN repository. First is using *git-svn* (detailed below), the second, less robust way is to use *svn-gource.py*, a script that converts the SVN xml log to Gource's custom log format.

== Using Gource with SVN projects via git-svn ==

Another approach you can take to use Gource with your SVN project is to import your project into a Git repository using the '`git svn`' command.

The below insturctions will work if your SVN repository has the standard three directories - trunk, tags and branches
(Otherwise, see the '`git svn`' documentation):

{{{
git svn init --stdlayout https://myrepo.example.org/svn my-repo.git
cd my-repo.git
git svn fetch
}}}

*Note:* `git svn fetch` may take hours if your repository is large.

You can pull new changes into the Git copy of your SVN repository at any time using the following command:

{{{
git svn rebase
}}}

== svn-gource.py ==

[http://bitshifter.net.nz/ Bitshifter] has contributed a python script [http://gource.googlecode.com/files/svn-gource-1.2.tar.gz svn-gource.py] that converts the xml output of the `svn log` command into a format that can be read by the gource custom log format option.

Synopsis:

{{{
cd my-svn-project
svn log --verbose --xml > my-project.log
python svn-gource.py --filter-dirs my-project.log > my-project-gource.log
gource --log-format custom my-project-gource.log
}}}

*Note*: The `--filter-dirs` option treats paths without extensions as directories and filters them out (files and directories are ambiguous in the SVN log output so this is a work around).

This script requires Python version 2.5 or above.
