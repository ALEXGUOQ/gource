#summary An overview of the controls that affect the appearance of Gource

== Bloom ==

Gource has some command line options to control the appearance of the 'light bloom' effect that appears around directories. You can affect the radius of the bloom using `--bloom-multiplier`, and the intensity using `--bloom-intensity`.

To get double the radius and double the normal intensity you would use:

{{{
gource --bloom-multiplier 2.0 --bloom-intensity 1.5
}}}

If you're sick of the bloom effect, you can turn it off with `--disable-bloom`.

== Background Colour ==

The background colour can be set with the --background option followed by a colour in hex format (like in HTML):

{{{
gource --background 555555
}}}

Will set the background colour to a darkish grey.

== Camera Controls ==

=== Camera Mode ===

Gource has two camera modes - tracking the entire visible repository, or tracking users (all users, or a specific user when one is selected).

A lot of Gource videos just use the default Camera setting, which is to track the entire visible repository. This is good for establishing shots, but I think tracking the active users is usually more interesting.

You can toggle the mode with the *V* key. *Tab* cycles though the current visible users.

=== Zoom ===

You can change the maximum zoom distance with the *Mouse Wheel* and the *Up/Down Arrow Keys*.
