#summary An overview of the controls that affect the appearance of Gource

== Bloom ==

Gource has some command line options to control the appearance of the 'light bloom' effect that appears around directories. You can affect the radius of the bloom using `--bloom-multiplier`, and the intensity using `--bloom-intensity`.

To get double the radius and double the normal intensity you would use:

{{{
gource --bloom-multiplier 2.0 --bloom-intensity 1.5
}}}

If you're sick of the bloom effect, you can turn it off with `--disable-bloom`.

== Background Colour ==

The background colour can be set with the --background option followed by a colour in hex format (like in HTML):

{{{
gource --background 555555
}}}

Will set the background colour to a darkish grey.

== Camera Controls ==

=== Camera Mode ===

Gource has two camera modes (which can be changed with *--camera-mode MODE*):

 * *overview* - keeps the entire repository in view.
 * *track* - follows the current active users or the selected user.

You can toggle the mode in Gource with the *V* key. *Tab* cycles though the current visible users.

=== Panning ===

Dragging the left mouse button on the background pans the camera. This will also disable automatic camera movement until you toggle the camera mode.

=== Zoom ===

You can change the maximum zoom distance with the *Mouse Wheel* and the *Up/Down Arrow Keys*.

=== Rotation ===

By default, as of 0.27, Gource will automatically rotate the view to make best use of the available screen space.

You can manually rotate the view by dragging right mouse button on the background. This will also disable automatic camera rotation until you toggle the camera mode.
